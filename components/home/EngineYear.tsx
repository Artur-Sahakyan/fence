          The fence material you choose affects more than just the appearance â€”
          it impacts cost, durability, maintenance, privacy, and security. For
          example, wood offers a natural look but requires upkeep, while vinyl
          is low-maintenance and lasts longer. Chain-link is affordable and
          strong, ideal for security-focused areas. Choosing the right material
          ensures your fence meets your goals and budget for the long term.
